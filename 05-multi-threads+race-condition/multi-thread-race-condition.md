# 05 - Multi Threads
## Definition
Multithreads programming is the method allowing system to do more than one thing at a time as threads appear to run `concurrently`.

## Threads vs Processes
| Thread | Process |
| ------ | ------- |
| - run the same function | - may run different functions
| - share virtual memory resources | - copy program's memory space |
| - concurrency | - parallelism |
